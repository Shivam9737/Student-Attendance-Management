# Student Management System

[Link Project](https://github.com/Shivam9737/Student-Attendance-Management/)

## Overview

The Student Management System is a web application that allows users to manage and track student information, including names, phone numbers, cities, and roll numbers. It also provides an attendance history feature to track student attendance.

## Features

- **Add Students:** Users can add student information, including name, phone number, city, and roll number, using a web form.

- **Display Students:** The application displays a table with student information, including a roll number, name, phone number, city, and an option to mark attendance.

- **Attendance History:** Users can view the attendance history of students, filter students by attendance status (Present, Absent, or All), and navigate through the attendance records.

- **Navigation:** Users can navigate between the student management and attendance history pages.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend:** React.js is used for building the user interface, and React Router is used for client-side routing. Bootstrap is used for styling.

- **Backend:** A mock API is used to simulate data fetching for student information and attendance history.

Data Fetching
Student data is fetched from a mock API endpoint for demonstration purposes. In a real-world scenario, you would replace this with an actual API or database connection.

Attendance history data is also fetched from a mock API endpoint. The data includes student names, dates, and attendance statuses.
